        Plot draws a theatrical lighting plot in SVG from an XML description.
        
        Version 0.0.1 opens a file named as
        {$user.home}/Plot/plotfiles/{@code filename.xml,
        and writes out an SVG drawing as {$user.home}/Plot/out/{@code filename}.svg .
        In this version, no actual data is manipulated, but a hard-coded box is drawn
        and a title is inserted into the generated DOM to make sure I can do these
        things.

        <h2>Software Debt</h2>
        No software is perfect. In the interest of taking a finite amount of time to
        complete each release I have incurred a bit of debt. I hope to address these
        issues shortly:
        <ul>
            <li>Not enough tests are written - mostly because they require facilities of
            <code>testng</code> or <code>jmockit</code> that I do not yet understand.
            (0.0.1)</li>
            <li>I need to upgrade to Java 7. (0.0.1)</li>
            <li>Locations of input and output files are hard-coded into the program.
            There should be a facility for specifying these locations either on the
            command line or in a configuration file, or perhaps both. (0.0.1)</li>
            <li>Attempting to skip a test shows the test as skipped in the command line
            output but hangs in the NetBeans "Test Results" panel. Perhaps this will
            resolve itself when I upgrade to Java 7? (0.0.3)</li>
            <li>Made NetBeans Javadoc generator find the overview.html file by giving it
            a full pathname. How do I give it a relative pathname? (0.0.3)</li>
            <li>Uche Ogbuji suggests in
            <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-eleatt/index.html">
                Principles of XML design: When to use elements versus attributes</a>
            considerations that lead me to think that 'name' should not be an attribute
            of the {@code venue} tag, but should instead be a child of it. (0.0.5)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MobileTheaterTech web site is not yet configured. (0.0.1)</li>
            <li>Firefox 20.0 (on Mac OS X 10.8.2) fails to draw a the bottom part
            of a 1296 X 1320 rectangle. Opera 12.15 & Safari 6.0.2 display this just
            fine. (0.0.2)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Business Logic Debt</h2>
        Likewise, not every feature I could want is present in the software.
        <ul>
            <li>Of the Venue elements, only the outer perimeter of the room is supported.
            (0.0.2)</li>
            <li>Of the Plot elements, only {@code Stage} is supported. (0.0.3)</li>
            <li>It would be really nice if a bit of SVG animation showed the name (and
            other values?) of any given plot item. (0.0.5)</li>
            <li>The {@link com.mobiletheatertech.plot.Truss} representation is wrong.
            If I am representing
            individual pieces of gear, the length needs to be limited. If I am
            representing assemblies of truss segments, I should implement some means of
            breaking out the individual parts.</li>
        </ul>

                General flow is to Read in XML description of plot, then write out
                SVG drawing.

                The Read stage involves parsing the XML plot description, then
                running {@code verify()} on each {@code Minder} object. These are
                separate steps because it is possible that a given plot element needs
                information from other elements to be completely formed. E.g. a Truss
                needs information from a pair of {@code Suspend}s to locate itself in
                space.

                A solution that has the Truss constructor searching attempting
                to ferret out subordinate elements is too clunky and complex and
                requires that...

                It is easier to find one's single parent and perform some task
                depending on what is found than it is to search out some set of
                data from an arbitrary number of potential children.
